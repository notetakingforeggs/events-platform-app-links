# events-platform-app-links

### This is now redundant and needs to be deleted
- i tried to do applinks using google pages, but because you can't put things direclty after the .com (there is always the path of your repo) it means you cant put the .wellknown where it will be looked for.
- I hosted it on a different website but didnt delete this yet.
